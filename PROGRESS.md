# Energy Management System - Development Progress

## Today's Achievements

### Backend Development

1. **Enhanced User Management**

   - Implemented role-based access control (admin vs staff)
   - Added staff-specific power pack assignments
   - Created default users:
     - Admin: username `admin`, password `admin`
     - Staff 1: username `staff1`, password `staff1`
     - Staff 2: username `staff2`, password `staff2`

2. **Location Management**

   - Added location data storage in `locations.json`
   - Implemented location-specific features:
     - Building A: 10,000W capacity
     - Building B: 15,000W capacity
     - Building C: 20,000W capacity
   - Each location has assigned devices (power packs and inverters)

3. **Device Management**

   - Added device types (power packs and inverters)
   - Implemented device-location associations
   - Created device-specific controls and monitoring

4. **Data Access Control**

   - Implemented `get_user_data()` function
   - Admin users can access all data
   - Staff users can only access their assigned power pack and locations

5. **Power Control System**

   - Enhanced control settings with device-specific controls
   - Improved time-based control with hours, minutes, and seconds
   - Added validation for device access
   - Implemented single active control per device

6. **Mock Data Generation**
   - Updated mock data generation to include device-specific data
   - Improved data distribution across locations and devices
   - Added realistic power consumption patterns

### Frontend Development

1. **Login Page**

   - Created modern login interface
   - Implemented error handling and validation
   - Added responsive design

2. **Dashboard**

   - Implemented real-time power monitoring
   - Added power control interface
   - Created data visualization components
   - Added theme toggle functionality

3. **Navigation**
   - Connected all pages with proper routing
   - Implemented session management
   - Added role-based access to different sections

### Security Features

1. **Authentication**

   - Implemented secure password hashing
   - Added session management
   - Created login required decorator

2. **Access Control**
   - Role-based access restrictions
   - Device-specific access control
   - Location-based data filtering

### Data Management

1. **Storage System**

   - Implemented JSON-based data storage
   - Created separate files for:
     - Users (`users.json`)
     - Locations (`locations.json`)
     - Consumptions (`consumptions.json`)
     - Controls (`controls.json`)

2. **Data Processing**
   - Added real-time data calculation
   - Implemented consumption metrics
   - Created data filtering based on user roles

## Next Steps

1. Add power usage alerts and notifications
2. Implement scheduling features
3. Add more detailed analytics
4. Enhance security features
5. Add user management interface
6. Implement data export functionality
